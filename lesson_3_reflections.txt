**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you want to publish your code for other people to see & add to.
  This allows you to get valuable feedback or other versions of the same 
  thing you're working on, allowing you to work with multiple people on 
  the same project.


**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because you want to keep control of what you publish & don't publish.
  A file you're working on may also be un-finished, so you wouldn't want 
  to sync a potentially corrupt file.
