**What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    This starts tracking the directory you initialised git on & will show any 
    files within as "untracked", due to the fact that you haven't committed 
    any changes yet.
    You need to do this so you can start tracking & committing changes to files.


**How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is the bit inbetween the working directory & the repository.
    Any files that you're going to want to commit from the working directory, 
    need to get added to this staging area before being able to do so.
    The benefit of this is that it allows you to review exactly what files 
    you're going to want to commit, before doing so.


**How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    By using "git diff" without any arguments to check what changes you have made 
    between the working directory & the staging area. If you see that a logical 
    change has been made, commit it.
